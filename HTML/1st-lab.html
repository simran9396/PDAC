A committed nationalist since his teenage years, he became a rising figure in Indian politics during the upheavals of the 1910s. He became the prominent leader of the left-wing factions of the Indian National Congress during the 1920s, and eventually of the entire Congress, with the tacit approval of his mentor, Mahatma Gandhi.

Members take vows of chastity, poverty, and obedience, and also profess a fourth vow â€“ to give "wholehearted free service to the poorest of the poor."[9]</p>
